      _picture-in-painting_ is a video installation exploring the attention economy surrounding
      artwork. If you check your phone while watching a film, maybe you should watch a film while looking
      at a painting? bort.jpg?inline

      Paintings are far too static, and should we even like them anymore? one person painted the
      sistine chapel, thousands of people worked on the minions movie, so its kind of a factor of
      multiplication type thing.
