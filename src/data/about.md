The homepage mainly says what I need to, but lets say it again here. I really like what I get
to do for a living, I know its tough out there, I'm very lucky in many ways. I've tried very
hard in life and probably chosen work over other things that I sometimes shouldn't have, but
where its landed me I'm very fortunate for and don't take for granted.

Not a lot of stuff has any point in life, not in a depressing way, but in a way that it gets
quite fatiguing having to care about things when we all know that they don't matter.

I hope this website skews irreverent, but it might skew cynical. Anyway a little about me
really, I do use code for nearly everything I do, but in my personal practice I try put that
code to usages outside the screen as much as I can.

I love teaching, and love the opportunity to teach or run workshops, so please do let me know
if you wanted to do something in that field.
